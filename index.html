    After all the stock data was analyzed I decided the best option to invest in was Tesla. They are having some problems right now with the publicity but I think it will eventually all blow over and the stocks will quickly rebound. The highs it reached this year where by far the highest. And with all the new products and innovation coming out of Tesla I feel like this is a safe bet to invest in as Tesla shows the have tons of potential.
